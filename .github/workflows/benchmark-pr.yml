  # Note: This relies on the PR compiler being published into the local machine
  # cache (Ivy/Coursier) and the subsequent benchmark jobs running on the same
  # self-hosted runner machine. GitHub does not guarantee runner affinity
  # between jobs. If/when multiple runners share the [self-hosted, benchmarks]
  # label, we'll need a different way to make the published artifacts available
  # (or merge publish+benchmark into one job / use a remote repository / use
  # concurrency + single runner).
  #
  # Note: Each job imports and pushes results independently.
  #
  # Note: the benchmark.yml workflow could be called with a list of versions to
  # benchmark in one job, but we run them separately with a matrix because a
  # single long-running job would time out after 6 hours. This is a bug in
  # GitHub actions. We should normally be able to run jobs on self-hosted
  # runners for up to 5 days, but this doesn't work with "workflow_call". See
  # https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/50481 and
  # https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/limits.
