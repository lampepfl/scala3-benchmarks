  # Note: This relies on the PR compiler being published into the local machine cache
  # (Ivy/Coursier) and the subsequent benchmark job running on the same self-hosted
  # runner machine. GitHub does not guarantee runner affinity between jobs.
  # If/when multiple runners share the [self-hosted, benchmarks] label, we’ll need a
  # different way to make the published artifacts available (or merge publish+benchmark
  # into one job / use a remote repository / use concurrency + single runner).
