# Scala Yaml

Copied from https://github.com/VirtusLab/scala-yaml/tree/v0.3.1.

Tests can be run via `sbt "benchScalaYaml/runMain org.virtuslab.yaml.test.TestRunner"`. The [test/TestRunner.scala](test/TestRunner.scala) entry point was added to run all munit tests without a separate test configuration.
